Simple HTTP and REST client for Crystal, inspired by the Ruby's RestClient gem.

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  crest:
    github: mamantoha/crest
```

## Usage

```crystal
require "crest"
```

Basic usage:

```crystal
Crest.get(
  "http://example.com/users",
  params: {:lang => "en"}
)

Crest.post(
  "http://example.com/users",
  payload: {:age => 27, :name => {:first => "Kurt", :last => "Cobain"}}
)
```

### Passing advanced options

`Crest::Request` accept next parameters:

Mandatory parameters:

* `:method` - HTTP method (`:get`. `:post`, `:put`, `:patch`,  `:delete`, `:options`)
* `:url` - URL (e.g.: "http://httpbin.org/ip")

Optional parameters:

* `:payload` -  a hash containing query params
* `:headers` -  a hash containing the request headers
* `:cookies` -  a hash containing the request cookies
* `:params` -  a hash that represent query-string separated from the preceding part by a question mark (`?`) a sequence of attributeâ€“value pairs separated by a delimiter (`&`)
* `:user` and `:password` -  for Basic Authentication
* `:p_addr`, `:p_port`, `:p_user`, and `:p_pass` - specify a per-request proxy by passing these parameters
* `:max_redirects` -  maximum number of redirections (default to 10)
* `:logging` -  enable logging (default to `false`)
* `:logger` -  set logger (default to `Crest::CommonLogger`)

More detailed examples:

```crystal
Crest::Request.execute(:get,
  "https://example.com/resource",
  params: {:width => 640, "height" => "480"},
  headers: {"Content-Type" => "application/json"})
)

Crest::Request.new(:post,
  "http://example.com/resource",
  headers: {"Content-Type" => "application/json"},
  payload: {:width => 640, "height" => "480"}
)

Crest::Request.new(:get,
  "http://example.com/resource",
  user: "admin",
  password: "1234"
)

Crest::Request.new(:get,
  "http://example.com/resource",
  p_addr: "127.0.0.1",
  p_port: 3128,
  p_user: "admin",
  p_pass: "1234"
)
```

### Multipart

Yeah, that's right! This does multipart sends for you!

```crystal
file = File.open("#{__DIR__}/example.png")
Crest.post("http://example.com/upload", payload: {:image => file})
```

```crystal
file = File.open("#{__DIR__}/example.png")
resource = Crest::Resource.new("https://example.com")
response = resource["/upload"].post(payload: {:image => file})
```

### JSON payload

`crest` does not speak JSON natively, so serialize your payload to a string before passing it to `crest`.

```crystal
Crest.post(
  "http://example.com/",
  headers: {"Content-Type" => "application/json"},
  payload: {:foo => "bar"}.to_json
)
```

### Headers

Request headers can be set by passing a hash containing keys and values representing header names and values:

```crystal
response = Crest.get(
  "http://httpbin.org/headers",
  headers: {"Authorization" => "Bearer cT0febFoD5lxAlNAXHo6g"}
)
response.headers
# => {"Authorization" => ["Bearer cT0febFoD5lxAlNAXHo6g"]}
```

### Cookies

`Request` and `Response` objects know about HTTP cookies, and will automatically extract and set headers for them as needed:

```crystal
response = Crest.get(
  "http://httpbin.org/cookies/set",
  params: {"k1" => "v1", "k2" => "v2"}
)
response.cookies
# => {"k1" => "v1", "k2" => "v2"}

response = Crest.get(
  "http://httpbin.org/cookies",
  cookies: {"k1" => "v1"}
)
response.cookies
# => {"k1" => "v1"}
```

### Basic authentication

For basic access authentication for an HTTP user agent you should to provide a `user` name and `password` when making a request.

```crystal
Crest.get(
  "http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd",
  user: "user",
  password: "passwd"
)
```

### Proxy

If you need to use a proxy, you can configure individual requests with the proxy host and port arguments to any request method:

```crystal
Crest.get(
  "http://httpbin.org/ip",
  p_addr: "localhost",
  p_port: 3128
)
```

To use HTTP Basic Auth with your proxy, use next syntax:

```crystal
Crest.get(
  "http://httpbin.org/ip",
  p_addr: "localhost",
  p_port: 3128,
  p_user: "user",
  p_pass: "qwerty"
)
```

### Logging

By default, the `Crest` does not enable logging. You can enable it per request by setting `logging: true`:

```crystal
Crest.get("http://example.com/resource", logging: true)
```

You can create the custom logger by integration `Crest::Logger` abstract class.
Here has two methods must be implement: `Crest::Logger.request` and `Crest::Logger.response`.

```crystal
class MyLogger < Crest::Logger
  def request(request)
    @logger.info ">> | %s | %s" % [request.method, request.url]
  end

  def response(response)
    @logger.info "<< | %s | %s" % [response.status_code, response.url]
  end
end

Crest.get("http://example.com/resource", logging: true, logger: MyLogger.new)
```

### Resource

A `Crest::Resource` class can be instantiated for access to a RESTful resource,
including authentication, proxy and logging.

Additionally, you can set default `params` and `headers` separately.
So can use `Crest::Resource` to share common `headers` and `params`.

The final `headers` and `params` consist of:

* default headers from initializer
* headers provided in call method (`get`, `post` etc)

This is especially useful if you wish to define your site in one place and
call it in multiple locations.

```crystal
resource = Crest::Resource.new(
  "https://example.com",
  params: {"key" => "value"},
  headers: {"Content-Type" => "application/json"}
)

response = response["/admin/users"].get(
  headers: {"Auth-Token" => "secret"}
)

response = response["/post"].post(
  payload: {:height => 100, "width" => "100"},
  params: {:secret => "secret"}
)
```

With HTTP basic authentication:

```crystal
resource = Crest::Resource.new(
  "https://httpbin.org/get",
  user: "user",
  password: "password"
)
```

With Proxy authentication:

```crystal
resource = Crest::Resource.new(
  "https://httpbin.org/get",
  p_host: "localhost",
  p_port: 3128
)
```

 Use the `[]` syntax to allocate subresources:

```crystal
site = Crest::Resource.new('http://example.com')
response = site["/api/article"].post({:title => "Hello world", :body => "Crystal is awesome!"})
```

### Exceptions

- for result codes between `200` and `207`, a `Crest::Response` will be returned
- for result codes `301`, `302`, `303` or `307`, the redirection will be followed and the request transformed into a `GET`
- for other cases, a `Crest::RequestFailed` holding the Response will be raised
- call `.response` on the exception to get the server's response

### Redirection

By default, `crest` will follow HTTP 30x redirection requests.

To disable automatic redirection, set `:max_redirects => 0`.

```crystal
Crest::Request.execute(method: :get, url: "http://httpbin.org/redirect/1", max_redirects: 0)
# Crest::RequestFailed: 302 Found
```

## Result handling

The result of a `Crest::Request` is a `Crest::Response` object.

Response objects have several useful methods.

- `Response#body`: The response body as a string
- `Response#status_code`: The HTTP response code
- `Response#headers`: A hash of HTTP response headers
- `Response#cookies`: A hash of HTTP cookies set by the server
- `Response#request`: The `Crest::Request` object used to make the request
- `Response#http_client_res`: The `HTTP::Client::Response` object
- `Response#history`: A list of each response received in a redirection chain
